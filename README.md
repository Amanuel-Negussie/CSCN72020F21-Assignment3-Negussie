This Assignment was to test my understanding on the TCP/IP and UDP/IP protocols and how to implement them with no libraries. 

Inspiration was found in 'Hands On Network Programming with C' by Lewis Van Winkle as its text (available to current students via O'Reilly Books Online).   Code within this repository is taken from, or adapted from code presented in this text.
